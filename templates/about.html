          Ralleio school is one of the pilot locations in the euPolis Front Runner City of Piraeus. It is a school with a long
          history in the City of Piraeus and operates as an Experimental School overseen by the Department of Education of the
          University of Athens. Its innovative nature, due to experimentation with different teaching approaches in primary education
          and its participation in various educational research programmes and other research initiatives, make it ideal as an euPolis
          pilot site.
