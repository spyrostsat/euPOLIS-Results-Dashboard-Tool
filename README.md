Some Info On The Project:

Ralleio school is one of the pilot locations in the euPolis Front Runner City of Piraeus. It is a school with a long history in the City of Piraeus and operates as an Experimental School overseen by the Department of Education of the University of Athens. Its innovative nature, due to experimentation with different teaching approaches in primary education and its participation in various educational research programmes and other research initiatives, make it ideal as an euPolis pilot site. A range of different potential NBS (Nature-Based Solutions) interventions are being investigated for implementation in the school.
